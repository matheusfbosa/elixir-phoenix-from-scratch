# elixir-phoenix-from-scratch

This repository contains three distinct projects developed in Elixir. These projects are part of the "Elixir e Phoenix do zero" course.

## FizzBuzz

The "FizzBuzz" project consists of an Elixir module that reads an input file containing integer numbers, applies the logic of the FizzBuzz game to these numbers, and returns the result. The code includes unit tests to verify functionality. This project demonstrates the use of Elixir to process files and apply conditional logic.

## ExMon

"ExMon" is a turn-based game implemented in Elixir. Players can create characters with different moves and engage in battles. The code includes unit tests to ensure the game functions correctly. This project serves as an example of how to create a simple game in Elixir and use processes to manage the game state.

## Bank

The "Bank" project is a REST API built with Elixir and Phoenix. It offers features for managing users, accounts, and banking transactions. The code includes unit tests to verify API functionality. The project also provides a `docker-compose.yml` file to set up a development environment with PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. This project is an example of how to create a backend application using Phoenix to handle banking operations.
